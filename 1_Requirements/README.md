# INTRODUCTION

Door Sensor Alarm System is a project that enables to sense the Door is open or closed.This project can be use in home , organisation , and many other places.
This is implemented in C . C is a platform independent language.Its created project can be used on a standalone machine.

# OBJECTIVE
The objective is to construction an electronic circuit that acts as a watch dog.It is used to protect a door when it is ON. It sounds an alarm when the door is open. Alerting you if someone opens, or tries to open , the doors in your home.

# 4W and 1H

## Who
Anyone can use Door Alarm System in home, in hospital, in any organization.

## What
Door Alarm System can be very effective home security device.

## Why
This project uses simple functions.It is very easy to work.

## Where
This Project is used in any entry point in home and some other front door.

## How
 By using atmega328P microcontroller it can be achieved.
 This Project requires a lost cost of development.
 
 ##Detail requirements
# High Level Requirements
  In this Project we use a atmega328P microcontroller , a LED , an audio out device and a resistor.
  
  1.This  can be use in door of a car. If door of a car is open then this buzzer will produce sound and LED will glow.
  
  2.This can be use in a home for security purpose.  alerting you if someone tries to open the door.


# Low Level Requirements
  This project can be implemented by using c language in both windows and linux os. # Implemented
